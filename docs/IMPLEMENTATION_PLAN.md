## Guiding Principles

1. **Local-first**: All data stays on user's machine. No cloud dependencies for core functionality.
2. **Citation-grounded**: Every claim must be backed by a source. No hallucinations.
3. **Boring technology**: SQLite, Python, simple file parsers. No exotic dependencies.
4. **Manual commands**: User triggers actions explicitly. No background daemons or automation.
5. **Metadata always**: Every piece of data includes: project, date, language, source.

---

## Boring Defaults

These are intentionally simple choices that prioritize reliability over sophistication:

| Category   | Default Choice         | Why                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Database   | SQLite + sqlite-vec    | Single file, no server, portable                   |
| Embeddings | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`     | Fast, 384 dims, good enough for most use cases     |
| Chunking   | 512 tokens, 50 overlap | Standard for retrieval, not too fragmented         |
| Search     | Pure vector similarity | Simple, deterministic, debuggable                  |
| Output     | Plain text + citations | Machine-readable, no formatting magic              |
| Mode       | Boring B.O.B (neutral) | Trust-first default; Coach Mode is opt-in          |
| LLM        | None (Phase 1-5)       | Retrieval is the hard part; generation is optional |
| Interface  | Local web UI           | Browser-native, no build step, inspectable         |
| API        | Local HTTP only        | FastAPI, single-process, manual start              |

---

## What We Are Not Doing

These are explicit non-goals to avoid scope creep:

- ❌ **Cloud sync or collaboration** — This is a personal tool
- ❌ **Real-time file watching** — Index manually when ready
- ❌ **Remote/cloud API** — Local-only; no remote exposure by default
- ❌ **Multiple databases** — One SQLite file per user
- ❌ **Complex ranking models** — Start simple, add complexity only with evidence
- ❌ **Auto-summarization** — Return passages, let user read
- ❌ **Internet search** — Local documents only
- ❌ **Always-on daemons** — Manual server start only
- ❌ **Personal data in repo** — `/data` is gitignored; never commit content
- ❌ **Desktop app (yet)** — Web UI first; Tauri/Electron later if needed
- ❌ **Ambient surveillance** — No screen/audio memory, no passive capture

---

## Phase 1: Core Retrieval

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| sqlite-vec not available on all platforms | Users can't search             | Fallback to brute-force numpy search   |
| Large PDFs cause memory issues            | Indexing fails                 | Add file size limits, streaming parser |
| Locators become stale after edits         | Citations point to wrong place | Re-index on file change, warn on date  |

### Definition of Done

### Status: ✅ Complete

### Prerequisites

- Phase 1 complete (core retrieval working via CLI) ✅

### Features

1. **API Framework**

   - [x] FastAPI server in `bob/api/`
   - [x] Single-process, local-only binding (127.0.0.1)
   - [x] Manual start: `bob serve` command
   - [x] Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C
   - [x] CORS configured for local development

2. **Core Endpoints**

   - [x] `POST /ask` — Query with answer + citations + footer fields

   - [x] `GET /index/{job_id}` — Get indexing progress and errors
   - [x] `GET /projects` — List all projects
   - [x] `GET /documents` — List documents with filters
   - [x] `POST /open` — Request to open file at locator (returns instruction)

   > **Note:** `GET /decisions` and `GET /recipes` endpoints are Phase 5 features that require the Decision Layer to be implemented first.

3. **Response Format**

   - [x] All responses include structured JSON with consistent schema
   - [x] Every `/ask` response includes: answer, sources[], date_confidence, may_be_outdated
   - [x] Error responses follow RFC 7807 Problem Details

4. **Job Management**

   - [x] In-memory job queue (single-user, no persistence needed)
   - [x] Progress reporting via polling

   > **Note:** Job cancellation is a nice-to-have for Phase 4+.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `bob serve` starts server on localhost:8080 (configurable)
- [x] `POST /index` starts background job and returns immediately
- [x] API only binds to localhost by default
- [x] All endpoints documented with OpenAPI spec

> **Note:** Performance benchmark (`<500ms for 10k chunks`) to be validated in Phase 4 with real-world data.

### Test Plan

| Test               | Description                               | File                         |

| Integration: Ask   | Full query pipeline via API               | `tests/test_api_ask.py`      |
| Integration: Index | Indexing job lifecycle via API            | `tests/test_api_index.py`    |
| Security: Binding  | Server only accepts localhost connections | `tests/test_api_security.py` |

### Risks

| Risk                            | Impact             | Mitigation                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| API adds latency vs direct call | Slower queries     | Keep serialization minimal            |
| Port conflicts                  | Server won't start | Configurable port, clear error msg    |
| Concurrent requests on indexing | Race conditions    | Single-threaded queue, reject if busy |

### Definition of Done

## Track: Routines & Deep Integration

**Goal:** Turn B.O.B into a daily-use partner by shipping guided routine actions, canonical templates with linting, safe deep access, a metrics-powered Fix Queue, and Coach Mode guidance that keeps the experience grounded in the local chunk → embed → store pipeline (metadata always includes project, date, language, source).

### Status: 🔄 In Progress (routine endpoints + UI pages + feedback/fix-queue signals implemented; lint implemented; connectors/coach integration pending)

### Prerequisites

- Phase 3 “Ask + citations-first UI” is live so every routine can hook into the existing sources footer and Coach Mode toggle.
- `docs/ROUTINES_SPEC.md` and `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` are written so implementation knows the vault paths, templates, scope rules, and failure cases for each action.
- Retrieval pipeline chunk → embed → store is stable and metadata enforcement is in place.

### Features

1. **Routine entry points & templates**

   - The seven routine actions (Daily Check-in, End-of-Day Debrief, Meeting Prep, Meeting Debrief, Weekly Review, New Decision, Trip Debrief) are implemented via `/routines/<action>` with vault patterns, templates, and retrieval queries described in `docs/ROUTINES_SPEC.md`; Fix Queue is surfaced via `GET /health/fix-queue`.
   - Each routine writes via the canonical templates stored under `docs/templates/`; the `/routines/<action>` endpoints return the rendered note path plus the cited retrieval buckets that drove it.
   - Routines appear as cards on the `/routines` screen and Fix Queue tasks can target routines; Coach-triggered routine suggestions remain planned.

2. **Capture hygiene linting**

   - Implemented: lint rules for missing rationale, rejected options, metadata, and next actions surface in Fix Queue tasks with file paths; Coach Mode surfacing remains planned.
   - Implemented: lint output feeds Fix Queue task lists alongside feedback and permission signals.

3. **Safe deep access via permissions**

   - The Level 0-3 scope model in `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` constrains routine writes and logs permission denials when scope/path checks fail.
   - Calendar import and browser-save connectors remain planned and are not wired to API endpoints or UI toggles yet.

4. **Feedback loop & Fix Queue**

   - Every answer renders feedback controls (Helpful / Wrong or missing source / Outdated / Too long / Didn’t answer) that call `POST /feedback` and log `{question, timestamp, project, retrieved_source_ids, answer_id, feedback_reason}` locally.
   - `GET /health/fix-queue` currently derives tasks from not-found feedback frequency, repeated questions, missing metadata, permission denials, and capture lint issues.

5. **Coach Mode integration**

   - Planned: Coach suggestions will recommend routines and Fix Queue-driven actions when Coach Mode is enabled and citations are available, with cooldown enforcement.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Routine APIs (`POST /routines/daily-checkin`, `.../meeting-prep`, `.../meeting-debrief`, `.../weekly-review`, `.../new-decision`, `.../trip-debrief`) are documented, return cited retrieval context, and respect scope/path checks.
- Templates in `docs/templates/` are used by routines and `POST /notes/create`; lint runner feeds Fix Queue tasks.
- Permission levels prevent unauthorized writes; connector flows remain opt-in and unimplemented until their endpoints exist.
- Feedback controls call `POST /feedback`, logging the local schema, and `GET /health`/`GET /health/fix-queue` expose not-found frequency, repeated questions, metadata deficits, permission denials, and capture lint issues.
- Coach Mode routine suggestions remain planned with citations and cooldowns.

### Test Plan

| Test | Description | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/test_routines_end_to_end.py` | Runs each `/routines/<action>` endpoint, verifies template write path, retrieval citations, and failure fallback behavior. | `tests/test_routines_end_to_end.py` |
| `tests/test_capture_lint.py` | Ensures lint rules flag missing rationale/rejected options/metadata/next actions and surface structured Fix Queue entries. | `tests/test_capture_lint.py` |
| `tests/test_permissions.py` | Verifies Level 0-3 scopes, optional connectors, and rejection logging while templates remain writable. | `tests/test_permissions.py` |
| `tests/test_feedback_and_fix_queue.py` | Posts feedback choices, checks local log schema, and confirms `GET /health`/`/health/fix-queue` return the prioritized metrics. | `tests/test_feedback_and_fix_queue.py` |

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval context insufficient for a routine action | Produces thin outputs and erodes trust | Surface chunk IDs and citations for every routine, allow manual overrides, and auto-log gaps via the Fix Queue. |
| Optional connectors feel automatic | Users worry about hidden capture | Keep calendar/browser imports opt-in, documented in `docs/PERMISSIONS.md`, and present their toggle state on the Routines screen. |
| Permission enforcement blocks valid flows | Routines break unexpectedly | Test scope enforcement thoroughly and log denied attempts so engineers can adjust allowed directories while keeping deep access explicit. |

### Definition of Done

- `docs/ROUTINES_SPEC.md`, `docs/PERMISSIONS.md`, and canonical templates under `docs/templates/` are authored and referenced by this plan, the UI plan, and the API contract.
- New UI routes `/routines` and `/health` (Fix Queue panel), the feedback controls, and the updated Coach Mode suggestion behavior are wired through the Ask screen.
- All routine, template, feedback, and permission APIs listed above are implemented, tested, and documented before Phase 4, and the Fix Queue metrics land before Phase 6 (Optional Generation).
- Feedback + Fix Queue metrics feed the health dashboards so the next optional generation improvements are informed by local log data.

| UI: Audit panel              | Panel renders and filters correctly               | Manual + E2E            |

### Risks

| Risk                          | Impact                | Mitigation                            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Audit data is confusing       | Trust decreases       | Clear labeling + defaults hidden      |
| Claim validation false alarms | Missing info          | Conservative matching and warnings    |
| Report export drifts          | Inconsistent citations | Golden tests for report format        |

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Audit payload returned in /ask
- [ ] UI panel shows retrieved vs used chunks
- [ ] Unsupported claims are blocked or marked
- [ ] Report export works offline

2. **Alternative: Electron**

   - [ ] Use if Tauri proves too complex
   - [ ] Larger size (~100MB) but simpler setup

3. **Distribution**
   - [ ] macOS .dmg with code signing
   - [ ] Windows .msi or portable .exe
   - [ ] Linux AppImage

### Definition of Done (if triggered)

- [ ] Desktop app launches and embeds web UI
- [ ] File opening works natively
- [ ] Can be distributed without Python installed
- [ ] Auto-start option available
